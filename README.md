# 📊 Netflix Content Analysis

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python*

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of Netflix titles to uncover meaningful trends in content types, genres, age certifications, runtimes, and IMDb ratings. Through detailed data cleaning and visualization, the project provides a clear understanding of how Netflix curates its global library.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform data preprocessing: handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, convert data types.
* Simplify complex fields such as `genres` and `production_countries` using custom parsing.
* Detect and visualize outliers in numerical features like `runtime`, `imdb_score`, and `seasons`.
* Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis to reveal distribution patterns and content trends.
* Derive key insights on what type of content dominates Netflix in terms of quantity and popularity.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **NumPy** – for numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
* **SciPy, AST, Random** – for statistical analysis and parsing
* **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive analysis

---

## ✅ Outcome

* Cleaned and structured Netflix dataset ready for further modeling or visualization tasks.
* Visual summaries of content types, genres, certifications, and country-wise trends.
* Clear understanding of audience-focused content curation patterns on Netflix.
* Insightful foundation for recommendation engines, content strategy, or user preference studies.
